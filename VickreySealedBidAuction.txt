Second price/ Vicrey Sealed Bid Auction:

Only one auction can be implemented at this contract and the winner pays the 
second highest bid. This type of auction is proven to be truthfull. The seller 
initilizes the value of the penalty (F) if a bidder tries to manipulate the auction process
and 2 time values (T1 for the bidding period and T2 for the reveal period). The seller
also provides F amount for the penalty of his own. The starter state sets to "Init" and the 
auction process begins. Each bidder can provide a bid with the function bid(comm) along
with a commitment comm which is a hash value (function: keccak256) of his bidding price and 
some salt for the illusion of the closed envelope bid. The bidder must provide al least F 
amount at his bidding for safety issues. This amount along with any excess money provided 
will be returned if the bidder is not a winner at the end of the auction. The money to be 
returned are saved at a mapping called ledger and with a struct named Biddings the information 
of the commitment is saved in the contract. After the biding period T1 each participant must call
the reveal(value, salt) function to verify the correctness of the bid. The bidder provides the 
value of the bid with the salt that he used and then the contract checks these values 
concatanated and hashed compared to the value of the commitment. If the bid was valid the 
appropriate information are saved at the struct of Bidders. After the process of revealing the 
bids ends then every one can call the winnerCalculation() function where the contract compares 
the valid bids and provides a winner or not along the highestBid and secondHighestBid values. 
The bidders who have not called the reveal function or haven't provided the valid values 
are penalized and the amount F is not returned. In contrast if a participant provides valid 
information and isn't the winner immediately gets his money back with the F value. In case 
there is no winner found the state changes to "WinnerNo" and the seller himself is penalized 
with the value F for not managing to implement a valid auction, otherwise his money are 
returned. In the case of a valid winner after the process the state is changed to "WinnerYes" 
and then the winner can call the winnerPaying() function for paying the appropriate amount and 
receiving the auctioned item. In case he never calls the function the penalty F is kept from 
the contract and never returned, otherwise he pays the secondHighestBid value and the remaining 
are returned to him. Then the state gets its final value of "WinnerPaid".
