Absolute Auction:

Only one auction can be implemented at a time with very specific characteristics. 
The seller is the one that deploys the contract along with a time value for the prefered period of bidding. 
This time value can be altered throughout the auction process with the function changeMaxTime(uint256 time).
A bid can be placed by calling the function addBid() and paying the bid and if the value and the timing is valid 
then the player and the bid become the current winning duo. When the current maxBidder changes, the previous holder 
gets immediately his money back. If the transfer fails after the end of the auction the player can try to take his 
money back with the function getBack(address bidder). Of course the final winner doesn't have access to this function 
and cannot back out of the payment. If a bid is placed in the last 5 minutes of the time remaining, a full 5 minutes will 
be available for bidding to surpass the previous bidder. This prevents any last minute bidding and winning. Thus, after 
every bidding there must be at least 5 minutes available for extra bidding challenges. In order to prevent an eternal auction 
of repeated biddings the seller can call the function finalCall and provide the final 5 minutes before the auction ends. No additional 
time is given after that. (There could be extra time with the function changeMaxTime but this is not fair for the bidders, 
and can be strategically manipulated by the seller.) After the proper time has passed, the function endAuction can be called 
and then the transfer of the money to the seller and the item to the winner happens.
